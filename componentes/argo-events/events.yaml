# Argo Events - Kustomization-based Deployment
# This approach avoids Application recursion by using Kustomize to reference official manifests
# The ApplicationSet will create an Application that points to this directory and processes the kustomization.yaml

# This file serves as documentation - the actual deployment uses kustomization.yaml
# which references the official Argo Events manifests to avoid recursion issues.

# The kustomization.yaml approach:
# 1. Uses the official install.yaml as remote base
# 2. Applies patches for GitOps integration 
# 3. Adds sync waves for proper deployment order
# 4. Avoids the Application-within-Application recursion problem

# ArgoCD will process the kustomization.yaml file in this directory
# No Application resource is needed here - that's handled by the ApplicationSet
