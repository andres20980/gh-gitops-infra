## 🔧 Technical Resolution Highlights

### Gitea PVC Synchronization Fix
**Problem:** Gitea was showing OutOfSync due to PersistentVolumeClaim resize limitation in Minikube
**Root Cause:** Minikube hostpath provisioner doesn't support PVC resizing
**Solution Applied:**
```yaml
persistence:
  enabled: true
  create: false                    # Don't create new PVC
  existingClaim: gitea-shared-storage

ignoreDifferences:
- group: ""
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  name: gitea-shared-storage
  jsonPointers:
  - /spec/resources/requests/storage
  - /spec/volumeName               # Ignore immutable fields
  - /spec/storageClassName         # Ignore immutable fields
```

**Result:** ✅ **Gitea now Synced + Healthy**
